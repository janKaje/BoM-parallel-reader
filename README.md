# BoM-parallel-reader
This is a program meant to help Book of Mormon readers in their study. It allows them to read two instances of the Book of Mormon side-by-side. Go to releases, find the latest one for your OS, download the .zip file, extract the folder, and run the application.

The main intended use of this is to read the Book of Mormon in two different languages side-by-side. By default when you open the window the program will open 1 Nephi chapter 1, with english on the left and spanish on the right. The two scroll independently, but using the `Sync` button you can make them scroll together. (Note that when synced, you can only scroll the left side. This will probably be fixed later.) Langauges and chapters for each side can be switched with the appropriate buttons.

Currently has 11 languages:
* Mandarin Chinese (simplified)
* English
* French
* German
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Japanese
* Korean
* Persian
* Spanish
* Swedish

Note that this is a buggy, unfinished version. There is no option to change font size, the text and background scale weirdly when you change the window size, and the menus can behave strangely at times. I hope to fix these issues and streamline the program later in the future. 

If there are any languages or features you would like to see added, open up an issue (or pull request if you know how) on GitHub.
