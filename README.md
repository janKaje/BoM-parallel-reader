# Book of Mormon Parallel Reader

## Description

This is a program meant to help Book of Mormon readers in their study. It allows them to read two instances of the Book of Mormon side-by-side. Go to releases, find the latest one for your OS, download the .zip file, extract the folder, and run the application.

The main intended use of this is to read the Book of Mormon in two different languages side-by-side. By default when you open the window the program will open 1 Nephi chapter 1, with English on the left and Spanish on the right. The two scroll independently, but using the `Sync` button you can make them scroll together. (Note that when synced, you can only scroll the left side. This will probably be fixed later.) Languages and chapters for each side can be switched with the appropriate buttons.

Note that this is a buggy, unfinished version. There is no option to change font size, the text and background scale weirdly when you change the window size, and the menus can behave strangely at times. I hope to fix these issues and streamline the program later in the future. 

If there are any features you would like to see added or bugs you find I haven't mentioned, open up an issue (or pull request if you know how) on GitHub.

## Languages

Currently supports all languages into which the Book of Mormon has been fully translated. (Temporary note - I haven't updated the release, so you'll have to download the latest commit and run it yourself. And feel free to download the language files yourself. Soon I'll move those to a separate repository and have the user choose which ones to download.) 

The Welsh version of the Book of Mormon has kept the pre-1879 chapter and verse breaks, making it pretty unusable for parallel reading, but until the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints updates the Welsh version, that's how it has to stay.

I wasn't able to find the Sinhala version of the Book of Mormon. The Church has translated versions of the Doctrine and Covenants as well as the Pearl of Great Price on their website, so I'm guessing there were serious errors with the translation and the Church has taken it down until they retranslate it.
